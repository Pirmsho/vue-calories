## Project Overview

This project was made by VueJs and Vue Router. As I am passionate about fitness, I thought it would be a good idea to make my own simple calorie counter app.

Main idea was to learn how to use forms and output different results depending on the input of the user in Vue.

If you plug in your stats in the counter, it will give you your BMR, daily calories to lose and gain weight, and also BMI numbers.
